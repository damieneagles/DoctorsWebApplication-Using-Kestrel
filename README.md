This ASPNET Web Core application uses .NET9, EF8 and MVC8 showing off some of the features.

It is arguably server farm ready with screens using efficient sorting, paging and page sizes.

Needs an IIS website called DoctorWebSite using https with the (IIS Express Development Certificate) to use SSL.

Installs an SQL Server database, whereever it can find a localDB.

To be used as a reference application as it is not quite polished so far, it still needs some more work to be useful to business.

See Screenshot RE SSL and remember IIS and IIS Express are two different products.
